If you can not log in (or even if you can, to be safe) ensure you have current versions of the following installed on your computer:

1. The [R software](https://cran.r-project.org/mirrors.html) itself, and
1. [RStudio Desktop](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/#download).

You will not be able to run RStudio without also having R installed.

You also need to download some files to follow this lesson:

1. Make a new folder in your Desktop called `r-novice-inflammation`.
2. Download [r-novice-inflammation-data.zip]({{ page.root }}/data/r-novice-inflammation-data.zip)
   and move the file to this folder.
3. If it's not unzipped yet, double-click on it to unzip it. You should end up
   with a new folder called `data`.
4. You can access this folder from the Unix shell with:

~~~
$ cd
$ cd Desktop/r-novice-inflammation/data
~~~
{: .language-bash}
